# bot-nodejs-demo
Demo of building a chatbot "bot" with NodeJS

## Stage 1
### git branch `stage-1-base-nodejs`
This is just the barebones structure for a Restify config to work with MS Azure

You can test this by running
`npm run dev`

and then navigating to `http://localhost:8080/echo/test`, you should then see in your browser:
```
{"name": "test"}
```

## Stage 2
### git branch `stage-2-basic-bot`

This is a continuation from Stage 1, but introduces
- Slack
- Howdy Botkit
- A very basic interaction

Create a bot by going here:
https://caruso.slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration

This is a CUSTOM bot, and not intended for public dissemination.  A public bot requires public registration, and is outside the scope of this project.

Get the OAUTH token that may look like xoxb-1234567...

NodeJS will expect this token under the environment variable slackToken.

To run type `npm run dev` however, you'll need environment variables for the Slack Token.

So you'll probably need to type in `export export slackToken=yyy && npm run dev` where yyy is the appropriate token/keys
